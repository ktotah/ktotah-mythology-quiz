<!-- high-scores.html -->
<!-- This page displays the high scores of the quiz.
     It is separated from the quiz and index pages to allow users to view scores independently, etierh after completing a quiz or directorly from the link in the page header. 
     The separation of html pages (index, quiz, and high-scores) enhances user experience and simplifies the management of different application states (starting the quiz, taking the quiz, viewing scores). -->
