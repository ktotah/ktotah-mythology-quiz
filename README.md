## Description
This project is a browser-based Greek Mythology Quiz, designed to test knowledge on Greek mythology in a fun and interactive way. It features a timer-based quiz system with multiple-choice questions and a high scores leaderboard, gamifying the quiz with this competitive aspect.

In creating this Greek Mythology Quiz, I furthered my understanding in dynamic HTML content manipulation using JavaScript, DOM manipulation, and local storage for storing high scores.

## Project Background
This project was created entirely from scratch as part of my journey to becoming a full-stack web developer. It is intended as a hands-on exercise in creating a dynamic web application using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Web APIs.
